# Angular2Minimal
just what you really need for angular2 nothing more except TsLint.

Clone this to your local and start working.

`
git clone https://github.com/stdeepak22/Angular2Minimal  my-proj
cd my-proj
`

This will pull the code and you will have it locally.  Now you need to pull related NPM package using below command
`
npm install
`

It will take sometime as it will download all the dependencies, and finally a new directory with the name of `node_modules` will be introduced at the same location.

Now just start the server and see the first Angular2 Minimal app.
`
npm start
`
